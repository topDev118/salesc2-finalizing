                    <p class="about-banner-text">Our team is comprised of former operations and sales professionals that made a career in the software and medical device industries.  We created SalesC2 as a result of having to deal with the same friction, inefficiencies, and challenges for years as we managed our territories and thought<br> “there has to be a better way.” <br>SalesC2 is that better way.  It provides total value to your sales team while eliminating distractions and yielding efficiency. </p>
